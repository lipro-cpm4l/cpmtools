.SH DESCRIPTION \"{{{
\fBcpmcp\fP copies one or more files to or from a CP/M disk.  When copying
multiple files, the last argument must be a drive or directory.  The drive
letter does not matter because the device is specified by the image, it is
only used to specify which direction you want to copy.  The user number is
specified after the drive letter, if omitted user 0 is used.
.PP
You can use \fB*\fP and \fB?\fP in CP/M file names, which have the same
meaning in
.IR sh (1)
file name patterns.
.\"}}}
.SH OPTIONS \"{{{
.IP "\fB\-f\fP \fIformat\fP"
Use the given CP/M disk \fIformat\fP instead of the default format.
.IP "\fB\-T\fP \fIlibdsk-type\fP"
libdsk driver type, e.g. \fBtele\fP for Teledisk images or \fBraw\fP for raw images 
(requires building cpmtools with support for libdsk).
.IP \fB\-p\fP
Preserve time stamps when copying files from CP/M to UNIX (not
implemented for copying the other way so far).
.IP "\fB\-s\fP \fIc\fP"
Replace slashes ('/') in CP/M names with character 'c' in host file names,
and perform the reverse translation when creating CP/M file names.
.IP \fB\-t\fP
Convert text files between CP/M and UNIX conventions.
.IP \fB\-u\fP
Use upper-case letters for host file names, instead of the normal
translation to lower-case.
